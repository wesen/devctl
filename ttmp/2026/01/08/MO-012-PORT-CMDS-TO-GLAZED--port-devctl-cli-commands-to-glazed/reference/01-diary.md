# Diary

## Goal

Track MO-012 work end-to-end: inventory devctl CLI verbs/flags, design a Glazed-based port plan (layers + help system), and break the plan into concrete tasks.

## Step 1: Create Ticket + Initial CLI Inventory

This step created the MO-012 ticket workspace and the initial “inventory + porting plan” analysis document. I also captured a complete list of devctl CLI verbs and their current flags, since the porting work depends on having a precise contract to map into Glazed layers.

The key observation is that devctl has a small set of stable, user-facing verbs (`up`, `down`, `status`, `logs`, `plan`, `plugins`, `tui`, `stream`) plus internal/testing verbs (smoketests, `__wrap-service`) and Cobra built-ins (`completion`, `help`). The port plan needs a shared “repo root” layer and consistent help system integration so that every command shares the same behavior and documentation surface.

**Commit (code):** N/A

### What I did
- Created the ticket:
  - `docmgr ticket create-ticket --ticket MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED --title "Port devctl CLI commands to Glazed" --topics devctl,glazed,cli,refactor,docs`
- Created docs in the ticket workspace:
  - `docmgr doc add --ticket MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED --doc-type reference --title "Diary"`
  - `docmgr doc add --ticket MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED --doc-type analysis --title "devctl CLI verb inventory and porting plan to Glazed"`
- Enumerated commands/flags from the current devctl CLI:
  - `cd devctl && go run ./cmd/devctl --help`
  - `cd devctl && go run ./cmd/devctl <cmd> --help` for each verb
- Identified Glazed references that will drive the port:
  - `glazed/cmd/glaze/main.go`
  - `glazed/pkg/doc/tutorials/05-build-first-command.md`
  - `glazed/pkg/doc/tutorials/custom-layer.md`
  - `glazed/pkg/doc/topics/01-help-system.md`

### Why
- A Glazed port is primarily an interface-mapping problem: we need an exact inventory of verbs and flags so we can build a stable set of Glazed layers and settings structs.

### What worked
- Ticket workspace created successfully and doc scaffolding is in place.
- devctl verb inventory is small enough to map exhaustively.

### What didn't work
- N/A.

### What I learned
- devctl’s current “global flags” already align well with a Glazed custom layer (repo-root/config/strict/dry-run/timeout), and logging is already using Glazed’s logging layer (so the help system integration should match `glaze` closely).

### What was tricky to build
- N/A (scaffolding only).

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- The recommended roll-out strategy (how to port without breaking UX or docs) once the mapping doc is complete.

### What should be done in the future
- Add a migration/testing playbook: side-by-side “old cobra command vs glazed command” snapshots and a checklist for equivalence.

### Code review instructions
- Start with the analysis doc that will drive implementation:
  - `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/08/MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED--port-devctl-cli-commands-to-glazed/analysis/01-devctl-cli-verb-inventory-and-porting-plan-to-glazed.md`

### Technical details
- devctl verbs observed via `--help`:
  - `up`, `down`, `status`, `logs`, `plan`, `plugins list`, `tui`, `stream start`, `smoketest*`
  - internal: `__wrap-service`

## Step 2: Verb Inventory → Glazed Porting Analysis (in progress)

This step translated the raw Cobra inventory into a concrete Glazed port plan: what the root command should look like, what custom layers we need, and a per-command mapping from existing flags to Glazed parameter definitions and settings structs.

The critical design decision captured here is to treat `repo-root` (and related config/timeout/strict/dry-run behavior) as a first-class reusable Glazed layer. Without that, each ported command would re-introduce ad-hoc parsing and defeat the purpose of the port.

**Commit (code):** N/A

### What I did
- Wrote the full inventory + port plan, including per-command flag mappings:
  - `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/08/MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED--port-devctl-cli-commands-to-glazed/analysis/01-devctl-cli-verb-inventory-and-porting-plan-to-glazed.md`
- Added an implementation task list aligned to the plan:
  - `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/08/MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED--port-devctl-cli-commands-to-glazed/tasks.md`
- Updated changelog for traceability:
  - `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/08/MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED--port-devctl-cli-commands-to-glazed/changelog.md`

### Why
- The port will touch many commands. Without a shared layer plan and per-command mapping, we’ll either miss flags or diverge behavior subtly across commands.

### What worked
- The CLI surface area is small and fully enumerable from `cmd/devctl/cmds/root.go`, making it realistic to be exhaustive.

### What didn't work
- N/A.

### What I learned
- The “right” unit of reuse is the repo-root/config normalization and timeout validation; it should not live in each command.

### What was tricky to build
- Capturing command substructure (`plugins list`, `stream start`) in a way that maps cleanly to Glazed command constructors while preserving Cobra-style grouping.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Whether to keep the current devctl outputs as-is (WriterCommand everywhere) vs introducing Glazed output formatting as an opt-in enhancement.

### What should be done in the future
- Decide whether dev-only commands (smoketests, internal wrapper) should be hidden/behind build tags in the Glazed-ported CLI.

### Code review instructions
- Start with the analysis doc, then the task list:
  - `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/08/MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED--port-devctl-cli-commands-to-glazed/analysis/01-devctl-cli-verb-inventory-and-porting-plan-to-glazed.md`
  - `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/08/MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED--port-devctl-cli-commands-to-glazed/tasks.md`

### Technical details
- Useful ticket entrypoints:
  - `docmgr doc list --ticket MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED`
  - `docmgr task list --ticket MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED`

## Step 3: Dev-only Smoketests: Move Under `dev smoketest ...` (in progress)

This step updates the port plan to keep the CLI’s user-facing surface area clean while still preserving the integration/smoke coverage that the existing smoketest verbs provide. Instead of shipping `smoketest*` as top-level verbs, they will live under a dev-only group: `devctl dev smoketest ...`.

This also introduces a concrete command layout convention we’ll follow going forward: commands are grouped in directories under `cmd/devctl/cmds/<group>/...`, and each group uses a `root.go` to register its children. This makes the eventual Glazed port easier to reason about because the command tree is explicit in the filesystem.

**Commit (code):** N/A

### What I did
- Searched the repo for all references to `smoketest` and `devctl smoketest-*` to identify call sites that must be updated:
  - `.github/workflows/push.yml`
  - `devctl/pkg/doc/topics/devctl-plugin-authoring.md`
  - Historical ticket docs under `devctl/ttmp/...`
- Updated the MO-012 plan to reflect the new command shape (`devctl dev smoketest ...`) and created explicit migration tasks:
  - `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/08/MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED--port-devctl-cli-commands-to-glazed/tasks.md`
  - `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/08/MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED--port-devctl-cli-commands-to-glazed/analysis/01-devctl-cli-verb-inventory-and-porting-plan-to-glazed.md`

### Why
- Top-level `smoketest*` verbs are useful for CI and developer workflows, but they expand the “product UX” surface area and clutter help/completions.
- Nesting them under `dev` makes the intended audience clear and avoids confusing end users while we migrate the main verbs to Glazed.

### What worked
- A deep ripgrep search found the concrete locations that will need updates once the CLI path changes (notably CI + docs).
- The ticket task list now includes an explicit smoketest refactor and a call-site update step.

### What didn't work
- The earlier idea of extracting smoketests into a separate binary is superseded by the stronger requirement to group commands under `devctl dev ...`.

### What I learned
- The `smoketest*` commands are referenced in both “living” docs (`pkg/doc`) and CI; those will break immediately if we change the CLI path without updating them.

### What was tricky to build
- Deciding what to treat as “must update now” vs “historical record”: older ticket docs contained `go run ./cmd/devctl smoketest-*` examples and `cmd/devctl/cmds/smoketest_*.go` paths, and we wanted those to remain copy/pasteable after the refactor.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Whether we want a temporary compatibility shim (aliases for `smoketest-*`) or to make this a clean breaking change and update all call sites at once.

### What should be done in the future
- Implement the `dev` + `smoketest` group command layout refactor in `cmd/devctl/cmds/...` and update all call sites (CI, docs, scripts).
- Decide (and document) whether we keep any temporary aliases for `smoketest-*`.

### Code review instructions
- Start with the updated plan sections:
  - `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/08/MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED--port-devctl-cli-commands-to-glazed/tasks.md`
  - `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/08/MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED--port-devctl-cli-commands-to-glazed/analysis/01-devctl-cli-verb-inventory-and-porting-plan-to-glazed.md`

### Technical details
- Repo-wide searches used to find call sites:
  - `rg -n "\\bsmoketest\\b" -S .` (from `devctl/`)
  - `rg -n "devctl\\s+smoketest" -S .` (from `devctl/`)

## Step 4: Implement `dev smoketest` Group + Update Call Sites (completed)

This step landed the actual CLI refactor: smoketests are no longer top-level verbs, and are now accessible under `devctl dev smoketest ...`. The `dev` group is hidden, so it doesn’t clutter the normal help surface, but it remains available for CI and developer workflows.

Alongside the code move, this step updated CI and docs to use the new command paths so that `go test` and the smoketest suite remain runnable and copy/pasteable without needing tribal knowledge.

**Commit (code):** b27aec404b887a5ec5cf98e887c5652fd6c686f0 — "devctl: move smoketests under dev group"

### What I did
- Refactored Cobra command registration so smoketests live under a `dev` group:
  - `devctl/cmd/devctl/cmds/root.go`
  - `devctl/cmd/devctl/cmds/dev/root.go`
  - `devctl/cmd/devctl/cmds/dev/smoketest/root.go`
  - `devctl/cmd/devctl/cmds/dev/smoketest/{e2e,logs,failures,supervise}.go`
- Updated CI + docs to the new CLI paths:
  - `devctl/.github/workflows/push.yml`
  - `devctl/pkg/doc/topics/devctl-plugin-authoring.md`
- Updated older ticket docs under `devctl/ttmp/...` so the smoketest commands and referenced file paths remain correct after the move.

### Why
- Keeps the user-facing CLI surface area focused while preserving high-value integration coverage for dev/CI.
- Establishes the filesystem-backed group convention (`cmd/devctl/cmds/<group>/...`) we’ll use while porting the main verbs to Glazed.

### What worked
- All smoketests still run successfully under the new paths.
- The CI workflow and docs no longer reference the removed `smoketest-*` top-level verbs.

### What didn't work
- N/A.

### What I learned
- Smoketest helper code that locates the devctl repo root via `runtime.Caller` is sensitive to directory depth; moving the command files required updating the “walk up” logic.

### What was tricky to build
- Keeping documentation consistent across both “living” docs and ticket docs: once the CLI path changed, any remaining `smoketest-*` references became immediate foot-guns.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Whether we should add temporary aliases for `smoketest-*` (currently: no aliases; we updated call sites instead).
- Whether `Hidden: true` for `dev` has any unintended impact on completion/help UX in shells we care about.

### What should be done in the future
- N/A.

### Code review instructions
- Start with the command tree change and registration:
  - `devctl/cmd/devctl/cmds/root.go`
  - `devctl/cmd/devctl/cmds/dev/root.go`
  - `devctl/cmd/devctl/cmds/dev/smoketest/root.go`
- Validate by running:
  - `cd devctl && go test ./... -count=1`
  - `cd devctl && GOWORK=off go run ./cmd/devctl dev smoketest e2e`

### Technical details
- Validation commands executed:
  - `cd devctl && go test ./... -count=1`
  - `cd devctl && GOWORK=off go run ./cmd/devctl dev smoketest`
  - `cd devctl && GOWORK=off go run ./cmd/devctl dev smoketest supervise`
  - `cd devctl && GOWORK=off go run ./cmd/devctl dev smoketest logs`
  - `cd devctl && GOWORK=off go run ./cmd/devctl dev smoketest failures`
  - `cd devctl && GOWORK=off go run ./cmd/devctl dev smoketest e2e`

## Step 5: Cobra↔Glazed Porting Friction Report (completed)

This step writes down the pain points we hit while trying to port a Cobra-first CLI to Glazed and collects concrete, actionable improvements that would make future ports significantly easier and less error-prone. The intent is to reduce “read a bunch of framework internals” work and replace it with a documented golden path and better primitives (persistent layers, duration/path types, clearer precedence docs, and dynamic command recipes).

The report is intentionally exhaustive and opinionated: it’s meant to be used as a backlog for Glazed (or for local wrappers around Glazed) and as a review guide for how we should structure `devctl` while we migrate core verbs.

**Commit (code):** N/A

### What I did
- Created and populated the report:
  - `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/08/MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED--port-devctl-cli-commands-to-glazed/analysis/02-cobra-glazed-porting-friction-report.md`
- Related key implementation files (Glazed builder/parser/middlewares and devctl root wiring) to the report for quick navigation.

### Why
- Porting risk is dominated by “subtle wiring mistakes” (flags/layers/help/precedence), not by translating command bodies.
- Capturing the confusing parts while they are fresh makes it easier to either improve Glazed upstream or build a small local “app builder” wrapper that creates a stable porting foundation.

### What worked
- The friction areas cluster into a small number of concrete themes (persistent flags/layers, precedence, parameter types, dynamic commands), which suggests high-leverage fixes are realistic.

### What didn't work
- N/A (documentation step).

### What I learned
- The hardest part of the port is not writing commands; it’s reconciling Cobra’s persistent/global-flag model with Glazed’s layer-based parsing model in a way that preserves UX and avoids double-registration.

### What was tricky to build
- Being precise about what “confusing” means without drifting into un-actionable complaints; the report is structured to map each pain point to concrete improvement proposals.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Whether the proposed improvements should land upstream in Glazed vs be implemented as a small local “glazed app builder” wrapper inside `devctl` for faster iteration.

### What should be done in the future
- N/A (the report’s “Concrete improvement proposals” section is the follow-up list).

### Code review instructions
- Start with the report itself:
  - `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/08/MO-012-PORT-CMDS-TO-GLAZED--port-devctl-cli-commands-to-glazed/analysis/02-cobra-glazed-porting-friction-report.md`

### Technical details
- N/A
