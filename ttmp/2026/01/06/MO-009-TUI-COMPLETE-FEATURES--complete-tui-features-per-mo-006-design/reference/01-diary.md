# MO-009: TUI Complete Features - Development Diary

## Overview

This diary documents the planning and implementation of all missing TUI features identified in the MO-008 gap analysis to bring the `devctl tui` to full design parity with MO-006.

## 2026-01-07

### Step 1: Ticket Creation (21:23)

Created this ticket to track the comprehensive implementation of all missing TUI features.

#### Background
- MO-006 defined the original TUI design with ASCII mockups
- MO-008 implemented basic styling with lipgloss and fixed visual issues
- Gap analysis (`MO-008/.../03-gap-analysis-vs-design.md`) identified 50+ missing features

#### What I did
- Created ticket MO-009-TUI-COMPLETE-FEATURES using docmgr
- Reviewed the original design document thoroughly
- Created comprehensive implementation plan with 8 phases, 75+ tasks

#### Key Documents Created
- `design/01-implementation-plan.md` - Full implementation plan with:
  - Data layer requirements (process stats, health checks, env vars)
  - UI changes for each view (dashboard, service, events, pipeline, plugins)
  - ASCII mockups showing target state
  - Code snippets and type definitions
  - Task dependencies graph
  - Recommended implementation order

- `tasks.md` - Checklist of all 75 tasks organized by phase

#### Design Decisions

1. **Data-First Approach**: Phase 1 focuses on data layer (process stats, health, env vars) before UI, because many features depend on this data being available.

2. **Events View First**: Recommended starting with Phase 4 (Events enhancements) because it has low dependencies and high visibility - quick wins.

3. **Plugin View Last**: Plugin list is lowest priority since plugins are mostly static config.

4. **New Widget for Progress Bars**: Phase 5 requires a new progress bar widget for build steps.

5. **Process Stats via /proc**: On Linux, read `/proc/[pid]/stat` for CPU/MEM. Fallback to `ps` on macOS.

### Architecture Notes

#### Data Flow for Process Stats
```
/proc/[pid]/stat → ReadProcessStats() → StateSnapshot.ProcessStats
                                              ↓
                                     DashboardModel.View()
                                     ServiceModel.View()
```

#### Data Flow for Health Checks
```
Service Config (health endpoint) → Supervisor Health Poller → StateSnapshot.Health
                                                                     ↓
                                                          DashboardModel.View()
                                                          ServiceModel.View()
```

#### Events Enhancement Architecture
```
EventLogEntry {
    At:     time.Time
    Text:   string
    Source: string    // NEW: "backend", "system"
    Level:  LogLevel  // NEW: DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR
}

EventLogModel {
    entries:        []EventLogEntry
    serviceFilters: map[string]bool  // NEW
    levelFilters:   map[LogLevel]bool // NEW
    paused:         bool              // NEW
    eventsPerSec:   float64           // NEW
}
```

### What Warrants Discussion

1. **Health Check Implementation**: Where should health check logic live? Options:
   - In supervisor as a goroutine
   - In TUI as polling
   - Separate health daemon

2. **Environment Sanitization**: Need clear rules for what to redact:
   - Keys containing: PASSWORD, SECRET, TOKEN, KEY, CREDENTIAL, API_KEY
   - Should we allow override via config?

3. **Live Build Output**: Currently build output isn't streamed to TUI. Need to:
   - Add output channel to build executor
   - Create PipelineLiveOutputMsg
   - Wire through Watermill or direct channel

4. **Plugin Enable/Disable**: The design shows enable/disable actions but current implementation may not support runtime plugin state changes.

---

### Next Steps

Recommended order for implementation:

1. **Quick Win**: Phase 4.1-4.2 (Events source/level columns)
   - Low effort, immediate improvement
   - No backend changes needed

2. **Foundation**: Phase 1.1 (Process stats)
   - Enables dashboard and service CPU/MEM
   - Requires new pkg/proc/stats.go

3. **Dashboard Polish**: Phase 2.1-2.2
   - High visibility improvement
   - Depends on Phase 1.1

4. **Continue from there based on capacity**

---

### Step 3: Phase 1 Implementation - Data Layer (21:30)

Implemented all 12 tasks for Phase 1 (Data Layer Enhancements).

#### 1.1 Process Stats

**Created `pkg/proc/stats.go`**:
- `type Stats` - CPU%, MemoryMB, MemoryRSS, VirtualMB, State, Threads, StartTime
- `type CPUTracker` - Tracks CPU usage across samples for delta calculation
- `func ReadStats(pid, tracker)` - Reads from `/proc/[pid]/stat`
- `func ReadAllStats(pids, tracker)` - Batch read for multiple PIDs
- `func GetProcessStartTime(pid)` - Returns when process started
- `func GetBootTime()` - Reads system boot time from `/proc/stat`

**Key design decisions**:
- CPU percentage calculated as delta between samples (requires tracker)
- Reads from `/proc/[pid]/stat` directly for Linux
- Handles zombie detection and process state

#### 1.2 Health Check Data

**Updated `pkg/tui/state_events.go`**:
- Added `HealthStatus` type (unknown/healthy/unhealthy)
- Added `HealthCheckResult` struct with service name, status, check type, endpoint, error, response time

**Updated `pkg/tui/state_watcher.go`**:
- Added `checkHealth()` to poll health for all services with health config
- Added `runHealthCheck()` for single service check
- Added `checkTCP()` and `checkHTTP()` health check implementations
- Health results included in StateSnapshot

**Updated `pkg/state/state.go`**:
- Added `HealthType`, `HealthAddress`, `HealthURL` fields to ServiceRecord
- Health config now stored in state.json for later polling

**Updated `pkg/supervise/supervisor.go`**:
- Copies health config from ServiceSpec to ServiceRecord at launch

#### 1.3 Environment Variables

**Created `pkg/state/sanitize.go`**:
- `func SanitizeEnv(env)` - Redacts sensitive values
- Patterns detected: PASSWORD, SECRET, TOKEN, KEY, CREDENTIAL, API_KEY, AUTH, PRIVATE, CERT, PASSPHRASE
- `func FilterEnvForDisplay(env, maxVars)` - Filters out noisy vars for display

**Updated `pkg/supervise/supervisor.go`**:
- Env sanitized at launch time before storing in state
- Added `StartedAt` timestamp to ServiceRecord

#### Updated `pkg/tui/styles/icons.go`

Added new icon functions:
- `HealthIcon(status)` - Returns filled/empty circle based on health status
- `EventIcon(eventType)` - Returns appropriate icon for event types

#### StateSnapshot Now Includes

```go
type StateSnapshot struct {
    RepoRoot     string
    At           time.Time
    Exists       bool
    State        *state.State
    Alive        map[string]bool
    Error        string
    ProcessStats map[int]*proc.Stats           // NEW: PID -> CPU/MEM stats
    Health       map[string]*HealthCheckResult // NEW: service name -> health
}
```

#### Files Created
- `pkg/proc/stats.go` (240 lines)
- `pkg/state/sanitize.go` (95 lines)

#### Files Modified
- `pkg/state/state.go` - Added StartedAt, HealthType, HealthAddress, HealthURL to ServiceRecord
- `pkg/tui/state_events.go` - Added HealthStatus, HealthCheckResult, updated StateSnapshot
- `pkg/tui/state_watcher.go` - Added health polling and process stats reading
- `pkg/tui/styles/icons.go` - Added HealthIcon, EventIcon functions
- `pkg/supervise/supervisor.go` - Store health config and sanitized env at launch

#### Testing
- `go build ./...` passes
- All packages compile without errors
- No test files yet (deferred to Phase 8)

### Step 4: Phase 2 Implementation - Dashboard Enhancements (21:45)

Implemented all 11 tasks for Phase 2 (Dashboard Enhancements).

#### 2.1 Health/CPU/MEM Columns

**Updated `pkg/tui/models/dashboard_model.go`**:
- Added new columns: Health, CPU, MEM to service table
- Created `formatCPU()` and `formatMem()` formatters
- Read CPU/MEM from `StateSnapshot.ProcessStats`
- Read health from `StateSnapshot.Health`
- Show "-" for missing data

**New table layout**:
```
| Name           | Status         | Health | PID    | CPU   | MEM   |
| backend        | Running        | ●      | 12847  | 12.3% | 245M  |
| frontend       | Dead (exit=1)  | ○      | 0      | -     | -     |
```

#### 2.2 Recent Events Preview

**Added to DashboardModel**:
- `recentEvents []tui.EventLogEntry` - Stores last 5 events
- `AppendEvent()` method - Called from RootModel when events arrive
- `renderEventsPreview()` - Renders compact event list with icons

**Event preview format**:
```
 14:23:45  [backend]    ℹ  Request completed in 234ms
 14:23:42  [frontend]   ✗  Build failed: missing dependency
```

#### 2.3 Plugins Summary

**Added to `pkg/tui/state_events.go`**:
- `PluginSummary` struct with ID, Path, Priority, Status

**Updated `pkg/tui/state_watcher.go`**:
- `readPlugins()` - Reads from `.devctl.yaml` config
- Checks if plugin path exists to determine status

**Added `renderPluginsSummary()` to DashboardModel**:
- Shows list of plugins with status icons
- Counts active plugins in title

**Plugin summary format**:
```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│Plugins (3 active)                                   [p] details  │
│ ✓ moments-config       (priority: 10)                            │
│ ✓ moments-build        (priority: 15)                            │
