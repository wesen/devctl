# Diary

## Goal

Analyze the current `devctl` TUI implementation against the MO-006 design baseline and produce a detailed refactoring guide for visual improvements using lipgloss and bubbles.

## Session

Session: MO-008-IMPROVE-TUI-LOOKS

## Step 1: Create ticket workspace and review MO-006 documentation

Set up the MO-008 ticket workspace and systematically reviewed all existing MO-006 documentation to understand the target UX and architecture. The MO-006 ticket contains extensive design work including ASCII mockups, implementation design, and a detailed working note on Watermill→Bubble Tea architecture.

### What I did
- Created ticket `MO-008-IMPROVE-TUI-LOOKS` via `docmgr ticket create-ticket`
- Read MO-006 source documents:
  - `sources/local/01-devctl-tui-layout.md` (full ASCII baseline with 6 screen mockups)
  - `design-doc/01-devctl-tui-layout-and-implementation-design.md` (implementation plan)
  - `design-doc/02-devctl-tui-layout-ascii-baseline.md` (curated baseline excerpts)
  - `working-note/01-devctl-tui-code-mapping-and-integration-analysis.md` (architecture)
  - `diary/01-diary.md` (23 implementation steps documenting the initial TUI build)

### Why
- Need to understand both the target state (ASCII mockups) and the architectural decisions already made (Watermill events, model composition, widget responsibilities)

### What worked
- The MO-006 documentation is comprehensive and well-structured
- The diary provides a complete history of implementation decisions through 23 steps

### What I learned
- MO-006 already defines a complete widget/model architecture in YAML format in the source layout doc
- The architecture uses: `RootModel` → `DashboardModel` / `ServiceModel` / `PipelineModel` / `EventLogModel`
- Watermill acts as the event bus boundary between domain events and Bubble Tea messages
- Current implementation matches the architecture—the gap is primarily visual

### What was tricky to build
- N/A (research step)

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- The scope boundary between "visual improvements" and "functional changes" should be confirmed

### What should be done in the future
- The MO-006 diary mentions several optional enhancements (health polling, CPU/MEM, plugin streams) that remain unimplemented

### Code review instructions
- Review MO-006 documentation for context on original design intent

### Technical details
- MO-006 diary spans Steps 1-23, covering: ticket setup → design docs → code mapping → Milestone 0 skeleton → logs + actions → pipeline view → fixture scripts

## Step 2: Analyze current TUI code structure and rendering

Read through all five model files in `devctl/pkg/tui/models/` to understand the current implementation and identify gaps against the target UX.

### What I did
- Read `root_model.go` (266 lines) - view coordinator and message router
- Read `dashboard_model.go` (274 lines) - services table and actions
- Read `service_model.go` (599 lines) - log viewport with follow/filter
- Read `pipeline_model.go` (500 lines) - phase/step/validation rendering
- Read `eventlog_model.go` (168 lines) - event timeline
- Read supporting files: `msgs.go`, `domain.go`, `pipeline_events.go`
- Verified dependencies: `lipgloss v1.1.1` and `bubbles v0.21.1` already in `go.mod`

### Why
- Needed to understand exactly what's implemented vs what's in the mockups
- Needed to identify which bubbles components are already in use

### What worked
- The code structure matches the MO-006 architecture closely
- Model composition and message routing are clean
- `viewport.Model` from bubbles is used for scrollable logs and events
- `textinput.Model` from bubbles is used for filtering

### What didn't work
- N/A

### What I learned
- Current rendering is entirely `fmt.Sprintf` and `strings.Builder` - no lipgloss usage
- All models have `View() string` methods that build plain text
- The `viewport.Model` instances are unstyled (no borders, no headers)
- No icons, no colors, no box-drawing characters
- lipgloss is in dependencies but completely unused in TUI code

### What was tricky to build
- N/A (analysis step)

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Whether to refactor incrementally (model by model) or do a larger coordinated change

### What should be done in the future
- Create a `styles/` package for centralized theming
- Create a `widgets/` package for reusable styled components

### Code review instructions
- Compare `models/*.go` View() methods against target ASCII screenshots

### Technical details
Key symbols analyzed:
- `RootModel.View()` - plain text header + child view
- `DashboardModel.View()` - `fmt.Sprintf` service list with `>` cursor
- `ServiceModel.View()` - plain text header + `viewport.Model.View()`
- `PipelineModel.View()` - `fmt.Sprintf` phase/step lists with `-`/`>` cursors
- `EventLogModel.View()` - plain text header + `viewport.Model.View()`

## Step 3: Create comprehensive analysis document

Produced the analysis document with detailed gap analysis, current/target ASCII screenshots, proposed architecture refactoring, and implementation roadmap.

### What I did
- Created analysis document via `docmgr doc add --ticket MO-008-IMPROVE-TUI-LOOKS --doc-type analysis`
- Wrote detailed gap analysis comparing current vs target
- Created ASCII screenshots showing current state (plain text rendering)
- Included target ASCII screenshots from MO-006 baseline
- Proposed new package structure: `styles/` for theming, `widgets/` for components
- Defined type signatures for new widgets (Box, Table, Header, Footer)
- Created 6-phase implementation roadmap

### Why
- Need a single reference document that guides the refactoring effort
- The document captures "what exists" vs "what should exist" clearly

### What worked
- Gap analysis tables make the differences actionable
- Type signatures provide a clear API target without full implementation
- Roadmap breaks work into reviewable chunks

### What didn't work
- N/A

### What I learned
- The main gap is truly visual—the model structure and data flow are already correct
- The refactoring can be done incrementally, model by model

### What was tricky to build
- Balancing detail (enough to guide implementation) with brevity (not writing the code itself)
- Keeping the document focused on "analysis" without slipping into implementation

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- The proposed widget API signatures—are they too prescriptive or flexible enough?
- Whether `widgets/` should be a separate package or inline in `models/`

### What should be done in the future
- Implement Phase 1 (styles foundation) first to establish the visual vocabulary
- Then proceed through widget library, dashboard, service, pipeline, events

### Code review instructions
- Review analysis document for completeness and accuracy
- Validate that the proposed architecture aligns with team preferences

### Technical details
Analysis document path: `devctl/ttmp/2026/01/06/MO-008-IMPROVE-TUI-LOOKS--improve-tui-looks-and-architecture/analysis/01-tui-architecture-and-visual-improvement-analysis.md`

Key sections:
- Executive Summary
- Current State ASCII Screenshots (4 views)
- Target State ASCII Screenshots (4 views from MO-006)
- Gap Analysis (tables for visual styling, layout, widgets, data structures)
- Proposed Architecture Refactoring (new packages, type signatures)
- Implementation Roadmap (6 phases with checkboxes)
- Key Files to Modify (table)
- Key Symbols Referenced (current implementation + lipgloss API)

## Step 4: Implement styles and widgets foundation (Phase 1-2)

Implemented the styles and widgets packages as defined in the analysis document, then refactored the Dashboard and Root models to use them for a polished visual appearance.

### What I did
- Created `pkg/tui/styles/theme.go`:
  - `Theme` struct with color palette (Primary, Secondary, Success, Warning, Error, Muted, Text, TextDim)
  - `DefaultTheme()` function returning a complete theme with pre-configured lipgloss styles
  - Base styles: Border, Title, TitleMuted, Selected, Keybind, KeybindKey, StatusRunning, StatusDead, StatusPending
  
- Created `pkg/tui/styles/icons.go`:
  - Unicode icon constants: `IconSuccess` (✓), `IconError` (✗), `IconWarning` (⚠), `IconInfo` (ℹ), `IconRunning` (▶), `IconPending` (○), etc.
  - Helper functions: `StatusIcon()`, `PhaseIcon()`, `LogLevelIcon()`

- Created `pkg/tui/widgets/box.go`:
  - `Box` struct for bordered containers with title and content
  - Fluent API: `NewBox()`, `WithContent()`, `WithTitleRight()`, `WithSize()`, `Render()`
  
- Created `pkg/tui/widgets/header.go`:
  - `Header` struct for styled title bar with status indicator and uptime
  - `Keybind` struct for keybinding hints
  - `RenderKeybinds()` helper for consistent keybind formatting
  
- Created `pkg/tui/widgets/footer.go`:
  - `Footer` struct for keybindings bar with separator
  - Centered keybinds layout

- Created `pkg/tui/widgets/table.go`:
  - `Table` struct with columns and rows
  - `TableColumn` and `TableRow` structs
  - Selection highlighting with cursor indicator
  - Icon-based status display

- Refactored `models/dashboard_model.go`:
  - `View()` now uses `widgets.Box`, `widgets.Table`, and styled components
  - Services rendered as a bordered table with icons (✓/✗)
  - Confirmation dialogs styled with warning borders
  - Added `renderStopped()` and `renderError()` helper methods

- Refactored `models/root_model.go`:
  - `View()` now uses `widgets.Header` and `widgets.Footer`
  - Header shows: title, system status icon, uptime, global keybinds
  - Footer shows view-specific keybindings (dynamic per active view)
  - Status line styled with success/error icons
  - Help overlay styled in a bordered box
  - Added `footerKeybinds()` method for view-specific keybindings

### Why
- Phase 1-2 of the roadmap establishes the visual vocabulary needed for all views
- Starting with dashboard provides immediate visible improvement
- Widget approach enables consistent styling across all views

### What worked
- lipgloss styling is straightforward and composes well
- The widget fluent API pattern (`NewBox().WithContent().Render()`) is ergonomic
- Build compiles cleanly after refactoring

### What didn't work
- Initially had unused `strings` import after refactoring dashboard
- Fixed by removing the unused import

### What I learned
- lipgloss `JoinVertical`/`JoinHorizontal` are the key composition primitives
- Keeping theme in a separate package enables consistent colors across widgets
- The `Width()` and `Height()` lipgloss methods are essential for layout control

### What was tricky to build
- Getting the header layout right with left/right alignment and spacing
- Ensuring the separator line respects terminal width

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- The color palette choices (purple primary, cyan secondary) may not match all terminal themes
- Whether the header/footer layout is optimal for narrow terminals

### What should be done in the future
- Apply similar styling to ServiceModel, PipelineModel, and EventLogModel
- Consider adding a dark/light theme toggle
- Test in various terminal emulators for color compatibility

### Code review instructions
- Run `cd devctl && go build ./cmd/devctl/...` to verify compilation
- Run `devctl tui` against a fixture repo to see the new styling
- Compare the visual output to the target ASCII screenshots in the analysis doc

### Technical details
New files created:
- `devctl/pkg/tui/styles/theme.go` - Theme definition
- `devctl/pkg/tui/styles/icons.go` - Unicode icons
- `devctl/pkg/tui/widgets/box.go` - Bordered container
- `devctl/pkg/tui/widgets/header.go` - Title bar
- `devctl/pkg/tui/widgets/footer.go` - Keybindings bar
- `devctl/pkg/tui/widgets/table.go` - Services table

Modified files:
- `devctl/pkg/tui/models/dashboard_model.go` - Uses widgets for rendering
- `devctl/pkg/tui/models/root_model.go` - Uses header/footer, styled help

## Step 5: Style remaining views (Phase 4-6)

Completed styling for ServiceModel, PipelineModel, and EventLogModel to bring all views up to the polished visual standard.

### What I did
- Refactored `ServiceModel.View()`:
  - Process info in a bordered box with status icon (✓/✗)
  - Stream selector with styled tabs (stdout/stderr)
  - Follow indicator with running icon (▶)
  - Exit info section with styled error display and stderr tail
  - Log viewport in a bordered box with scroll/filter hints
  - Added `renderStyledExitInfo()` helper method

- Refactored `PipelineModel.View()`:
  - Pipeline header with status icon and run info
  - Phases box with icons per phase state (✓/▶/○/✗)
  - Build/Prepare steps in bordered boxes with selection
  - Validation section with error/warning icons
  - Launch plan summary
  - Added helper methods: `phaseIconAndStyle()`, `formatStyledPhaseState()`, `renderStyledSteps()`, `renderStyledValidation()`

- Refactored `EventLogModel.View()`:
  - Events in bordered box with count
  - Each event line has contextual icon based on content
  - Error events: ✗ red
  - Success events: ✓ green  
  - Warning events: ⚠ yellow
  - Running events: ▶ green
  - Info events: ℹ gray

### Why
- Complete the visual improvement across all TUI views
- Ensure consistent styling language (icons, colors, borders)

### What worked
- The widget-based approach scales well to all views
- Icon selection based on content provides useful visual cues
- All views now have a consistent bordered/boxed look

### What didn't work
- N/A - all code compiled on first try after each refactoring

### What I learned
- Content-based icon selection (checking for "failed", "error", "ok:") provides good visual feedback without changing data structures
- The `lipgloss.JoinHorizontal/Vertical` primitives compose well for complex layouts

### What was tricky to build
- PipelineModel has a lot of state (phases, steps, validation, details) requiring careful layout
- Balancing information density with readability

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- The content-based event icon detection is heuristic-based and may not catch all cases
- Consider adding explicit level field to EventLogEntry for precise icon selection

### What should be done in the future
- Add color theme configuration (light/dark mode)
- Consider using bubbles table component for services instead of custom Table widget
- Add progress bars for long-running phases

### Code review instructions
- Run `devctl tui` against a fixture repo with services running
- Navigate through all views (tab to switch)
- Verify icons and colors are correct for different states

### Technical details
Modified files:
- `devctl/pkg/tui/models/service_model.go` - Styled process info, log viewport, exit info
- `devctl/pkg/tui/models/pipeline_model.go` - Styled phases, steps, validation
- `devctl/pkg/tui/models/eventlog_model.go` - Styled event timeline with icons

## Step 6: Visual Testing in tmux

Ran the TUI in tmux at various terminal sizes (80x24, 100x30, 120x40) to identify visual issues.

### What I did
- Started TUI in tmux session against fixture at `/tmp/devctl-tui-fixture-GkbBIS`
- Captured screenshots of all views (Dashboard, Events, Pipeline, Service for alive/dead)
- Tested window resizing
- Documented all issues found

### What I learned
- The resize event bubbling is working correctly (via `applyChildSizes()`)
- The issue is ServiceModel.View() not respecting height constraints
- Box borders add +3 lines that weren't accounted for in `reservedViewportLines()`
- Stray characters appear due to incomplete screen clearing

### Issues Found
See `analysis/02-visual-issues-found-during-testing.md` for full details.

Summary:
1. **Critical**: ServiceModel header cut off when viewing dead services (overflow)
2. **High**: Stray `╯` characters after header separator
3. **Medium**: Long paths/stderr lines wrap ungracefully
4. **Low**: PID truncated with ellipsis in dashboard
5. **Enhancement**: Large empty space in dashboard at larger sizes

### Root Cause Analysis
The `reservedViewportLines()` method in ServiceModel is based on OLD plain-text layout:
- It estimates ~6-11 lines for header content
- But new boxed layout uses `len(infoLines)+3` for info box (~10 lines)
- Plus exit info box (variable, 8-15 lines)
- Plus log box (`vp.Height+3`)
- Total can easily exceed `m.height` passed from RootModel

### What should be done next
1. ~~Refactor `reservedViewportLines()` to match actual box heights~~ ✅ Done
2. ~~Consider fixed-height sections with internal scrolling~~ ✅ Done
3. ~~Add string truncation helpers for long content~~ ✅ Done
4. ~~Pad lines to full width to prevent stray characters~~ ✅ Done

## Step 7: Fix visual issues found during testing

Fixed all critical and high-priority issues from `02-visual-issues-found-during-testing.md`.

### What I did
1. **ServiceModel height overflow** (Critical):
   - Redesigned ServiceModel.View() with fixed-height sections
   - infoBox: 6 lines (compact single-line status + path)
   - exitInfoBox: 6 lines (compact with 2 stderr lines max)
   - logBox: gets remaining space
   - Added `recalculateViewportHeight()` called from `syncExitInfoFromSnapshot()`
   - Aggressive truncation of long paths and stderr lines

2. **Stray border characters** (High):
   - Fixed header and footer widgets to generate separator with exact width
   - Previously used a fixed long string + truncation which didn't work for styled strings
   - Now generates `sepWidth` runes of '━' character
   - Added full-width padding to footer keybinds line

3. **String truncation** (Medium):
   - Added truncation for paths: `"..." + tail` if too long
   - Added truncation for stderr lines with `...` suffix
   - Added truncation for error messages in exit info

4. **PID truncation** (Low):
   - Removed "PID " prefix from table cell (header already says "PID")
   - Increased PID column width from 10 to 12
   - Increased Status column width from 16 to 18

### Technical changes
- `service_model.go`: New `exitInfoHeight()`, `renderCompactExitInfo()`, `recalculateViewportHeight()`
- `header.go`: Fixed separator generation using rune slice
- `footer.go`: Fixed separator generation using rune slice, added Width to keybinds line
- `dashboard_model.go`: Adjusted column widths

### Testing
Verified all views at 80x24:
- Dashboard: ✓ header visible, no stray chars, PIDs not truncated
- Service (alive): ✓ header visible, compact info, log viewport fills space
- Service (dead): ✓ header visible, compact exit info, log viewport visible
- Events: ✓ header visible, no stray chars
- Pipeline: ✓ header visible, no stray chars

### What I learned
- lipgloss Width() sets minimum width, not maximum - it doesn't truncate content
- String slicing on styled strings doesn't work because escape codes add bytes
- Need to calculate visual width separately from byte length
- Viewport height must be recalculated when content structure changes (alive→dead)
